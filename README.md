# LinkedIn Connection Remover

A browser extension that automates the process of removing connections from LinkedIn. Clean up your professional network efficiently.

## How It Works

This extension injects a content script into LinkedIn pages that:
1. Navigate to your connections page
2. Identifies connection elements in the page
3. Simulates clicks on the required buttons to remove connections
4. Handles confirmation dialogs
5. Continues through pagination to process all connections

The extension respects LinkedIn's UI patterns and adds random delays between actions to avoid triggering rate limits.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/asim8848/linkedin-connection-remover.git

// Paste and run the following command:

// To start removing connections with the default settings
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('startRemovingConnections'));

// With custom settings
document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('startRemovingConnections', { 
  detail: { 
    limit: 50,  // Maximum connections to remove
    delay: 2000 // Milliseconds between actions
  } 
}));
```
